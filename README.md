# Drawing-App
App where you can draw something on the screen.

In the app you can:
- Set the background from your gallery
- Change color of brush
- Change size of brush
- You can undo that what you drew
- You can save the image and share it

In new version I add:
- Forward button to restore what you drew
- New project button to create new project
